BloodLink - Bridging the gap between Donors and Blood banks

A patient is priority of any hospital however due to the current Blood replacement system operating in Pakistanâ€™s hospitals and blood banks the patients tend to suffer the most. There is no regular donor base for the blood banks thus they are unable to meet the blood needs and are forced into using Demand based model that requires patients to either arrange for blood on their own or give a bottle of blood to receive one. Even with this, there are many delays that have proven to be fatal.

For such a situation we have are going to build Blood Link, a system that allows blood banks to have a strong donor base, to monitor their blood bank status , be timely informed of possible blood depletion , and have a network with Blood donating organization and other blood banks. By offering such functionalities blood banks will be able to properly manage their blood donations and their blood banks and in the end provide properly for the patients.

Blood link is a web based application using ASP.Net platform. It will have allowed blood banks, regular donors and Blood donating organizations to have their own profiles according to their required functionalities. Beside from common functionalities the blood banks will have an analysis module for Blood bank blood level Monitoring, Blood Bank Depletion detection with alert generation and blood bank depletion prediction. The regular donors will be facilitated with mobile application where their profile, notifications and reward points would be visible and shared.
